=head1 NAME

Class::NonOO - Use methods as functions with an implicit singleton

=for readme plugin version

=head1 SYNOPSYS

In a module:

  package MyModule;

  use Class::NonOO;

  ...

  sub my_method {
     my ($self, @args) = @_;
     ...
  }

  as_function
    export => [ 'my_method' ], # methods to export
    args   => [ ];             # constructor args

The module can be be used with a function calling style:

  use MyModule;

  ...

  my_method(@args);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module allows you to turn a class into a module that exports
methods as functions that use an implicit singleton.

=head1 EXPORTS

=cut

our @EXPORT = qw/ as_function _Class_NonOO_instance /;

sub _Class_NonOO_instance {
    my $class = shift;
    my $user  = shift;
    state $symbol = '%_DEFAULT_SINGLETONS';
    my $stash = Package::Stash->new($class);
    my $instances = $stash->get_or_add_symbol($symbol);
    return $instances->{$user} //= $class->new(@_);
}

=head2 C<as_function>

  as_function
    export      => [ ... ], # @EXPORT
    export_ok   => [ ... ], # @EXPORT_OK (optional)
    export_tags => { ... }, # %EXPORT_TAGS (optional)
    args        => [ ... ], # constructor args (optional)
    global      => 0;       # no global state (default)

This wraps methods in a function that checks the first argument. If
the argument is an instance of the class, then it assumes it is a
normal method call.  Otherwise it assumes it is a function call, and
it calls the method with the singleton instance.

Note that this will not work properly on methods that take an instance
of the class as the first argument.

By default, there is no global state. That means that there is a
different implicit singleton for each namespace.  This offers some
protection when the state is changed in one module, so that it does
not affect the state in another module.

If you want to enable global state, you can set C<global> to a true
value.  This is not recommended for CPAN modules.

You might work around this by using something like

  local %MyClass::_DEFAULT_SINGLETONS;

but this is not recommended.  If you need to modify state and share it
across modules, you should be passing around individual objects
instead of singletons.
