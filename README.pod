=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module allows you to turn a class into a module that exports
methods as functions that use an implicit singleton.

=head1 EXPORTS

=head2 C<as_function>

  as_function
    exports => \@methods,
    args    => \@args;

This wraps methods in a function that checks the first argument. If
the argument is an instance of the class, then it assumes it is a
normal method call.  Otherwise it assumes it is a function call, and
it calls the method with the singleton instance.

Note that this will not work properly on methods that take an instance
of the class as the first argument.
